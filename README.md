# 🧍 CSV-Driven Character Animation in Unity

This Unity project demonstrates a **runtime animation system** where a rigged character is animated based on data read from a **CSV file**. The CSV contains frame-by-frame motion data such as joint positions or bone rotations, which are parsed and applied directly in the scene. This allows dynamic animation without traditional animation clips.
